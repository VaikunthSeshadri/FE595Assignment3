FE-595 Assignment 3 (Sentiment Sorting):
This will function as my readme file that shall guide you through the various python files that conduct sentiment analysis. 

1. "Assignment3-1.py" will merge different types of files like .csv and .txt into one large csv file and export it to the working directory.
2. "Assignment3 part 2.py" will look at the exported csv from the previous step and conduct sentiment analysis on the "Purpose" column. Based on the Compound score, we will determine the maximum and minimum and print those companies. 
3. "Assignment3-3.py" is used to find the top ten most used words in the purpose column. It is possible to use the nltk library to create tokens but I wanted specific words like "info-mediaries" to be counted as a single entity.
